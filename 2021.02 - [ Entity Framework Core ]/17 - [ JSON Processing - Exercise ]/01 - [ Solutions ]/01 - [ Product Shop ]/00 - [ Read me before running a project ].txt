If you want to run project:

1. Just copy StartUp.cs file from exercise that you want
2. Paste/Replace it with StartUp.cs file from folder 01 - [ Import Users ]
3. Run the project

The reason for that is because:
Every folder has the same files(Data, Datasets, Models, ProductShop.csproj....)
I decided to removed all of them and leave only the files in folder 01 - [ Import Users ]
