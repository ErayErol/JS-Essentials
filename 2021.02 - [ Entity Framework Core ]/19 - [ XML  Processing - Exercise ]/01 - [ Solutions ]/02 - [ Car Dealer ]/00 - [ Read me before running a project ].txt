If you want to run project:

1. Just copy StartUp.cs file from exercise that you want
2. Paste/Replace it with StartUp.cs file from folder 09 - [ Import Suppliers ]
3. If folder have DTO folder then copy DTO folder too
4. Run the project

The reason for that is because:
Every folder has the same files(Data, Datasets, Models, ProductShop.csproj....)
I decided to removed all of them and leave only the files in folder 09 - [ Import Suppliers ]
